        <p><b>Monsters, Inc.</b> is an energy company that was founded in 1810 as Amalgamated Monsters Ltd. before
            taking on
            its current name in 1895. Its main duty is to provide all citizens in Monstropolis with energy in the
            form of captured <b>screams</b> collected from children. They accomplish this by crossing into the human
            world
            through <u>door technology</u>, portals connected to closets of <i>children's bedrooms</i>, and scaring them
            to the best
            of their ability. The screams are then collected in special canisters for use as energy.

            The factory is an immense facility equipped to fulfill the needs of its employees. Scaring takes places in
            chambers called "Scare Floors", where the monsters cross over into the human world with the doors. Each
            scarer has an assistant to help coordinate the energy collection. Any door belonging to a child who has no
            fear of monsters is promptly destroyed in the Door Shredder, as their screams cannot be collected and are
            therefore obsolete.
